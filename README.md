# Complete Python Code for Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains Python code that loads, analyzes, and visualizes a dataset using the pandas and matplotlib libraries. The main dataset used in this example is the Iris dataset, but you can replace it with any CSV file of your choice.

## Project Overview

- **Loading and Inspecting Data**: The code loads the dataset and inspects its structure by checking the first few rows, data types, and missing values.
- **Basic Data Analysis**: Basic descriptive statistics and group-wise analysis are performed.
- **Data Visualization**: Four types of visualizations are generated:
  1. Line Chart (e.g., Petal length across species)
  2. Bar Chart (Average Sepal length per species)
  3. Histogram (Distribution of Sepal width)
  4. Scatter Plot (Sepal Length vs Petal Length

To run the code, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for the Iris dataset)

You can install these libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
